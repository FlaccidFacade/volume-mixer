## Architecture

### Service Lifecycle
```
User taps button → MainActivity → Intent → AudioSessionService
                                           ↓
                                    onCreate() (if new)
                                           ↓
                                    onStartCommand()
                                           ↓
                                    startForeground(notification)
                                           ↓
                                    Service Running
```

### Key Components
1. **AudioSessionService**: Foreground service managing lifecycle and notification
2. **MainActivity**: UI layer with service control
3. **NotificationManager**: System component displaying persistent notification
4. **Intent System**: Communication between MainActivity and Service

## Stub Functions for Future Implementation

The service includes two stub functions ready for future development:

1. **trackAudioSessions()**
   - Will monitor active audio sessions across apps
   - Detect when apps start/stop playing audio
   - Apply volume preferences from database

2. **stopTrackingSessions()**
   - Will clean up audio session monitoring
   - Release resources when service stops

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Completed)
- ✅ Service action constants verification
- ✅ Constant null checks

### Manual Testing (Pending - Requires Device/Emulator)
To be tested on Android device:
1. App opens successfully
2. "Start Service" button is visible
3. Tapping "Start Service" starts the foreground service
4. Notification appears with title "Volume Mixer Active"
5. Notification is persistent (cannot be dismissed)
6. Tapping notification opens MainActivity
7. Button changes to "Stop Service" when service is running
8. Tapping "Stop Service" stops the service
9. Notification disappears when service stops
10. Logcat shows:
    - "Service created" on first start
    - "Service running" on each start
    - "Service stopped" on destroy

### Logcat Commands for Testing
```bash
# View all AudioSessionService logs
adb logcat -s AudioSessionService:D

# View service logs with timestamps
adb logcat -v time -s AudioSessionService:D

# Clear and monitor logs
adb logcat -c && adb logcat -s AudioSessionService:D
```

## Android Version Compatibility

| Feature | Minimum SDK | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Foreground Service | API 26 (Oreo) | Base requirement |
| Notification Channel | API 26 (Oreo) | Required for notifications |
| Service Type Declaration | API 29 (Q) | mediaPlayback type |
| Runtime POST_NOTIFICATIONS | API 33 (Android 13) | Not yet implemented |
| FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK | API 34 (Android 14) | Declared in manifest |

**Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
**Min SDK**: 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo)

## Known Limitations

1. **Runtime Permission for Notifications**
   - POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission declared but not requested at runtime
   - On Android 13+, user must manually grant notification permission in settings
   - Future enhancement: Add runtime permission request dialog

2. **Service State Persistence**
   - Service state (running/stopped) not persisted across app restarts
   - UI resets to "Service is stopped" even if service is running
   - Future enhancement: Use bound service or shared state

3. **No Bound Service Interface**
   - Service currently unbound (returns null from onBind)
   - No real-time communication channel between service and UI
   - Future enhancement: Implement bound service with callbacks

4. **Stub Audio Session Tracking**
   - Audio session tracking functions are stubs (not implemented)
   - Service runs but doesn't track actual audio sessions yet
   - Future enhancement: Integrate with Android AudioManager

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. Implementation uses:
- AndroidX Core KTX (existing)
- Jetpack Compose (existing)
- Android SDK components (Service, Notification, etc.)

## Migration Notes
This implementation is additive - no breaking changes to existing code:
- Existing Room database integration remains intact
- Native JNI code unchanged
- Theme and UI components preserved
- All existing functionality maintained

## Next Steps for Audio Session Tracking

### Phase 1: Permission Handling
- Add runtime permission request for POST_NOTIFICATIONS on Android 13+
- Display permission rationale dialog
- Handle permission denial gracefully

### Phase 2: Audio Session Monitoring
- Implement AudioManager integration
- Register AudioPlaybackCallback
- Track active audio sessions
- Detect app package names playing audio

### Phase 3: Volume Control
- Read per-app preferences from AppVolumeDatabase
- Apply volume adjustments to active sessions
- Update volumes in real-time

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
- Add notification actions (quick volume controls)
- Display currently playing apps in notification
- Service binding for real-time UI updates
- Persist service state across restarts
