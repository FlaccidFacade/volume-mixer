# Implementation Notes - Issue #2: Foreground Service

## Quick Reference

### What Was Built
A foreground service for the Volume Mixer app that keeps the app alive and displays a persistent notification.

### Files Changed
- **Modified (3):** AndroidManifest.xml, MainActivity.kt, strings.xml
- **Created (2):** AudioSessionService.kt, AudioSessionServiceTest.kt
- **Documentation (4):** Implementation guide, architecture diagrams, testing guide, completion summary

### Statistics
- **Total Changes:** 1,414 lines added across 9 files
- **Code Files:** 5 (3 modified, 2 new)
- **Documentation:** 4 comprehensive guides
- **Test Files:** 1 unit test file

## Implementation Breakdown

### Core Service (AudioSessionService.kt - 107 lines)
```kotlin
Key Features:
- Foreground service with notification channel
- START_STICKY for automatic restart
- ACTION_START and ACTION_STOP intent handling
- Persistent notification "Volume Mixer Active"
- Logging at key lifecycle points
- Stub functions for future audio tracking
```

### UI Integration (MainActivity.kt - 66 lines changed)
```kotlin
Key Changes:
- Replaced placeholder with functional UI
- Added start/stop service button
- Service state indicator
- Intent-based service communication
- Compose UI with state management
```

### Manifest Configuration (AndroidManifest.xml - 10 lines added)
```xml
Permissions:
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS

Service Registration:
- mediaPlayback foreground service type
- Not exported (internal use only)
```

### Resources (strings.xml - 4 new strings)
```xml
- notification_title: "Volume Mixer Active"
- notification_text: "Audio session tracking is active"
- service_start: "Start Service"
- service_stop: "Stop Service"
```

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR 1: Unbound Service
**Decision:** Implement as unbound service initially
**Rationale:** 
- Simpler implementation for MVP
- No real-time communication needed yet
- Can be upgraded to bound service later
**Trade-off:** UI state doesn't reflect actual service state after app restart

### ADR 2: Intent-based Communication
**Decision:** Use Intent actions (START/STOP) for service control
**Rationale:**
- Standard Android pattern
- Simple and reliable
- Works from any component
**Trade-off:** No bidirectional communication

### ADR 3: Stub Functions
**Decision:** Include trackAudioSessions() and stopTrackingSessions() as stubs
**Rationale:**
- Clearly marks future implementation points
- Documents intended functionality
- Easy to extend in next iteration
**Trade-off:** No actual audio tracking yet

### ADR 4: Minimal UI Changes
**Decision:** Simple button-based UI
**Rationale:**
- Meets requirements
- Easy to test
- Can be enhanced later
**Trade-off:** Basic UX (state doesn't persist)

### ADR 5: No Runtime Permission Request
**Decision:** Don't implement POST_NOTIFICATIONS runtime request yet
**Rationale:**
- Android 13+ feature
- Not critical for initial implementation
- Can be added as enhancement
**Trade-off:** Users on Android 13+ must manually enable notifications

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Implemented)
- ✅ Service action constants verification
- ✅ Non-null checks

### Manual Tests (Documented, Not Automated)
- Service lifecycle (start/stop)
- Notification appearance/persistence
- UI state updates
- Background survival
- Rotation handling

### Future Automated Tests
- Instrumentation tests with Espresso
- Service binding tests
- Notification interaction tests
- Audio session tracking tests

## Performance Considerations

### Memory
- Service: ~5-10 MB overhead (typical foreground service)
- Notification: ~1-2 MB
- Total: Minimal memory footprint

### Battery
- Notification only: Negligible impact
- Future audio tracking: Will need monitoring

### CPU
- Current: Near-zero (just notification)
- Future: Will depend on audio session monitoring frequency

## Security Considerations

### Permissions
- FOREGROUND_SERVICE: Install-time permission (no security risk)
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS: User-controlled on Android 13+
- No sensitive data access

### Notification
- Non-dismissible while running (by design)
- Opens MainActivity only (no external actions)
- Uses immutable PendingIntent (secure)

## Compatibility Matrix

| Android Version | API Level | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 8.0 Oreo | 26 | ✅ Supported | Minimum SDK |
| 9.0 Pie | 28 | ✅ Supported | Full support |
| 10 | 29 | ✅ Supported | Service type added |
| 11 | 30 | ✅ Supported | Full support |
| 12 | 31 | ✅ Supported | Full support |
| 13 | 33 | ⚠️ Supported | Permission required |
| 14 | 34 | ✅ Supported | Target SDK |

⚠️ = Requires manual notification permission grant

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Service State Not Persisted
**Issue:** UI resets to "stopped" even if service is running
**Impact:** User confusion after app restart
**Workaround:** Check notification shade
**Fix:** Add service state persistence or bound service

### 2. No Runtime Permission Request
**Issue:** Notification permission not requested on Android 13+
**Impact:** Users must manually enable in settings
**Workaround:** Document in user guide
**Fix:** Add runtime permission request UI

### 3. Basic Notification
**Issue:** No quick actions or rich content
**Impact:** Limited user interaction
**Workaround:** N/A
**Fix:** Enhance notification with actions

### 4. Stub Audio Tracking
**Issue:** Audio session tracking not implemented
**Impact:** Service doesn't actually track audio yet
**Workaround:** N/A
**Fix:** Implement in next iteration

## Migration Path

### From Current to Full Implementation

**Phase 1 (Current):** ✅ Complete
- Foreground service structure
- Notification system
- UI controls
- Stub functions

**Phase 2 (Next):** Audio Tracking
- Implement trackAudioSessions()
- AudioManager integration
- Session callbacks
- Volume preference application

**Phase 3 (Future):** Enhanced Features
- Bound service for real-time updates
- Runtime permission requests
- Enhanced notifications
- State persistence

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Check Gradle daemon
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check logs
adb logcat -s AudioSessionService:D

# Verify service in manifest
adb shell dumpsys package com.volumemixer | grep -A 5 "Service"
```

### Notification Issues
```bash
# Check notification permission
adb shell dumpsys notification

# Verify channel
adb shell dumpsys notification | grep volume_mixer_channel
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity
- Service: Low complexity (linear flow)
- MainActivity: Low complexity (simple UI)
- Test: Minimal (constant checks only)

### Maintainability
- Well-commented code
- Clear separation of concerns
- Follows Android conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### Test Coverage
- Unit: ~10% (limited without instrumentation)
- Manual: 100% of critical paths documented
- Target: 80%+ when instrumentation tests added

## Dependencies

### No New Dependencies Added
All functionality uses existing dependencies:
- AndroidX Core KTX
- Jetpack Compose
- Android SDK (Service, Notification, etc.)

### Why No New Dependencies?
- Keeps app lightweight
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Standard Android APIs sufficient
- No external library needed

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1: Audio Tracking
- Integrate AudioManager
- Monitor audio sessions
- Apply volume preferences

### Priority 2: User Experience
- Runtime permission requests
- Service state persistence
- Enhanced notification

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
- Bound service interface
- Real-time UI updates
- Notification quick actions
- Per-session volume sliders

### Priority 4: Testing
